Pair with Target Sum : In this problem we have to take two variables from both end. As array is sorted so we can find the sum of both element and check is it greater than target sum or not. If target sum gater than sum of elements in that case increment left pionter else decrease right pointer. return true or false if find the sum.
Remove Duplicates : Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicate number instances from it in-place, such that each element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same and you should not use any extra space so that that the solution have a space complexity of O(1) : In this problem we have to take 2 pointers one is current index and next index. Start itarating from begining. If both number not same increase it if both same then start index fix it and increase only other index until find non similar element. Once u find replace with start index and swap it.
