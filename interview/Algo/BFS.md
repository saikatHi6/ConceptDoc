 - Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal. You should populate the values of all nodes of each level from left to right in separate sub-arrays.
    - Take a List of List to store the final node values from left to right
    - Take another Queue to store and traverse each level
    - Add root node to the queue
    - iterate a while loop until q is empty
    - initialize the level as q size
    - inside the while loop, create another list where we will add all nodes in that level
    - iterate from 0 to level using for loop
    - Pull the current node from q using the poll method and add to the list
    - check if there any left node if yes add to the q
    - check if there any right node if yes add to the q
    - after the for loop add the list to the final list
    - return the list of list
    
 - Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal in reverse order, i.e., the lowest level comes first. You should populate the values of all nodes in each level from left to right in separate sub-arrays.
    - Steps will be the same as above
    - Instead of a list of numbers, take a linked list. to add values from the front.
    - if isReverse then add front index. list.add(0,curNodeVal)
 - Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its zigzag level order traversal. You should populate the values of all nodes of the first level from left to right, then right to left for the next level and keep alternating in the same manner for the following levels.
    - Steps will be the same as above
    - Only take a boolean is reverse or not initialize with true
    - Instead of a list of numbers, take a linked list. to add values from the front.
    - if isReverse then add front index. list.add(0,curNodeVal)
    - else add list.add(curNodeVal)
 - Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent the averages of all of its levels.
    - Steps will be the same as 1st
    - instead of a list take an int value which calculates the sum of each level
    - sum divided by q size end of all nodes value in the level
    - add that in the final list
 - Find the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node to the nearest leaf node.
    - similar to the first only
    - we have to take a counter which will be used to calculate the current depth. the counter will be increased by one inside while loop.
    - inside the loop, we have to put a condition that depth will be returned if both left and right nodes are empty.
    - Note: to find the max, we must iterate over all the nodes and finally return the depth.
 - Given a binary tree and a node, find the level order successor of the given node in the tree. The level order successor is the node that appears right after the given node in the level order traversal.
    - Take a boolean flag false. update once find the successor
    - This is also the same as above but no need to traverse for loop in each level.
    - if the find successor is true then return the current value
    - every iteration first checks current node value is equal to the provided successor
    - if yes we will update it to find the successor's true
 - Given a binary tree, connect each node with its level order successor. The last node of each level should point to a null node.
    - It is the same as the first problem
    - we have to take the next node inside the TreeNode
    - we have to take another TreeNode variable which will be used to track the previous Node
    - if the previous node is not null then update previousNode.next =cur
    - end of the for loop update previousNode=cur
    - previous will be initiated null after each while iteration
 - Given a binary tree, connect each node with its level order successor. The last node of each level should point to the first node of the next level.
    - It is the same as above
    - No need to iterate over for loop will be updated the previous without checking its last node of level or not.
 - Given a binary tree, return an array containing nodes in its right view. The right view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is seen from the right side.
    - This is also the same as the first problem
    - Only we have to take a list
    - last iteration of for loop value will be update to the list
