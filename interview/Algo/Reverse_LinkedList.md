- Reverse the first ‘k’ elements of a given LinkedList.
- Given a LinkedList with ‘n’ nodes, reverse it based on its size in the following way:
   - If ‘n’ is even, reverse the list in a group of n/2 nodes.
   - If n is odd, keep the middle node as it is, reverse the first ‘n/2’ nodes and reverse the last ‘n/2’ nodes.
