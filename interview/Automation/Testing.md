## What Is Equivalence Partitioning?
Equivalence Partitioning is a testing technique that divides a program's input domain into data classes known as equivalence classes, which are then used to generate test cases. Each class specifies a group of inputs that the software should treat similarly.

The links within an equivalence class are symmetric, transitive, and reflexive, meaning that all components in the class are treated equally in terms of how the software processes them.

Testing one representative from each equivalence class allows testers to detect flaws efficiently without having to test every potential input.

This strategy ensures that the various input possibilities are sufficiently handled while reducing the number of test cases, making it a valuable concept to appear in software engineering interview questions.
