FC protocol uses optical or copper cables to connect SAN devices. FC operates at the physical and data link layers of the OSI model, and supports various upper layers of protocols such as SCSI, IP, and NVMe. FC is known for its low latency, high bandwidth, and long-distance reach. FC can deliver up to 128 Gbps of throughput per port, and up to 10 km of distance with single-mode fiber.
