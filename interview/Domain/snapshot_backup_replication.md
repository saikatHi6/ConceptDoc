## What is a storage snapshot?
A storage snapshot is a set of reference markers for data at a particular point in time (PIT).
    
    - It's a collection of saved application data.
    - Comprehensive log that details how the saved data has changed over time.
When these two elements are taken together, the storage snapshot lets an enterprise protect an application's data in real-time. It minimizes the recovery point objective while allowing workload managers to restore, or roll back, the application's data state to any previous PIT where a storage snapshot is available.
