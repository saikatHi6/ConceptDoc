It minimizes the recovery point objective while allowing workload managers to restore, or roll back, the application's data state to any previous PIT where a storage snapshot is available.
    

### What is a virtual hard disk (VHD)?
A virtual hard disk (VHD) is a disk image file format for storing the entire contents of a computer's hard drive.

It can be stored in any location accessible to the physical host, and it is also transportable, meaning it can be stored and moved with a USB flash memory device.

## Benifits of Virtualization 

1. Easier Management : Virtualization disguises the actual complexity of a storage system to help admin perform backup, recovery and archiving more easily and quickly. 
2.
