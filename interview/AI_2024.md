Prepare to tell me about yourself
    - Current Role [Headline Only]:
    - College
    - Post College & Onwards:
    - Current Role [Details]:
    - Outside of Work:
    - Wrap Up: I'm looking now for something new, and your company caught my eye. I've always loved the connection with the user, and I really want to get back to a 
             smaller environment too.
