https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1616482/System-Design%3A-Rate-Limiter

		How will you make it distributed?
		what challenges you forsee if distributed Rate limiter is implemented.
		Can you identify points of failures in this design.
		Handling failure when Rate Limiter service goes down
		Rate Limting done at other level of the OSI model
