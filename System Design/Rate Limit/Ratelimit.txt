=============Rate Limit=============

https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1616482/System-Design%3A-Rate-Limiter

		How will you make it distributed?
		what challenges do you foresee if a distributed Rate limiter is implemented?
		Can you identify points of failure in this design?
		Handling failure when Rate Limiter service goes down
		Rate Limiting done at other level of the OSI model


Why Rate Limiter?
			It decides whether to send a request to the server or not
			It is safe from overuse or DOS/malicious attack
			
		1. Manage operational cost 
		2. Security (Save from automated script & Dos)
		3. Preventing resource starvation (Some amount of request is free. User should have subscription model if the request is more than threshold amount of request)
		4. Control data flow

Rate limit can be placed on the Client side, Server side(best approach to handle requests from the backend), or middleware(if we use microservice based to place in API gateway).

<h1> Counters </h1>
	We need to use some kind of db to keep count of the request. There are 2 options Relational Database(1 request/millisecond means throughput of 1000 request/sec)/In memory cache DB(Redies:1 request/100 nanosecond Troughput: 10M request/sec ). 

Leaking Bucket Algo (used by Nginx, Amazon Elastic cloud & API Gateway )
