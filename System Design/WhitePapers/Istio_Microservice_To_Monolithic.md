## Benifits of Monolithic architechture over Microservice


   We should consider the architectural design before making decisions. Questions should ask before taking decisions. 
   1. What Was the Team Hoping to Achieve With Microservices?
   2. Had the Team Considered Alternatives to Using Microservices?
   3. How Did the Team Know Microservices Were Not Working?

> ## Learnings from Istio microservice architecture failures: 
>  - In most Istio installations, all control plane components are installed and operated by a single team or individual. This means that most Istio components are not delivered and managed independently from one another. Consequently, Istio operators were paying the price of the greater operational complexity inherent to a
microservice architecture without benefiting from it.
>  - Full security isolation is not attainable in the control plane as well. This is because multiple control plane services hold nearly equivalent roles in securing the behavior of the proxy and are installed by default into the same Kubernetes namespace. Thus, exploiting any of these services would cause near-equal damage. Therefore, moving the Istio control plane to a monolithic architecture turned out to be the right architectural decision.
