### Garbage Collection:
Garbage collection is essential to achieve high performance and latency. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) automatically allocates memory when objects are created and reclaims it when they are no longer needed. This automatic process is both a blessing and a challenge for developers, especially in low-latency environments.

### Garbage collection in Java works in phases:

 - Object Creation & Heap Allocation: Objects are allocated memory in the heap.
 - Object Reachability Analysis: The GC uses algorithms like GC Roots Tracing to identify unreachable objects.
 - Garbage Collection Process: The GC frees the memory occupied by unreachable objects and compacts memory (in some strategies).
 - Memory Reclamation: The freed memory is returned to the heap for future allocations.

### Choosing the Right Garbage Collector

- Serial GC: Ideal for small applications with low memory footprint. Not suitable for low-latency applications due to longer GC pauses. Algorithm: Uses a single thread to perform GC.
- Parallel GC (Throughput Collector): Focuses on maximizing application throughput by utilizing multiple threads for garbage collection. However, it still suffers from significant pause times, making it less ideal for low-latency applications. Algorithm: Uses multiple threads for GC, improving efficiency in multi-core systems.
- CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep): Designed to minimize pause times by performing most of its work concurrently with application threads. While it offers lower pause times, CMS can suffer from fragmentation and longer overall GC times. Algorithm: Runs concurrently with the application to reduce pause times.
- G1 (Garbage-First Collector): Aims to provide a good balance between throughput and pause times. It works by dividing the heap into regions and prioritizing the collection of regions with the most garbage, hence the name ‘Garbage-First’.Algorithm: Divides the heap into regions and prioritizes GC in regions with the most garbage.
- ZGC (Z Garbage Collector): The newest collectors designed for low-latency applications. They aim to achieve pause times of less than 10ms, even on large heaps, by performing most tasks concurrently with the application threads. Algorithm: Uses colored pointers to perform low-latency GC with minimal stop-the-world pauses.
- Shenandoah Garbage Collector : Algorithm: Uses concurrent garbage collection with region-based memory management.


### Code Optimization Techniques

- Choosing the Right Data Structure: The choice of data structure has a significant impact on performance. For instance, ArrayList is usually faster than LinkedList for random access, but LinkedList is faster for removing elements in the middle of the list.

- Primitive Types Over Boxed Types: Use primitive types (int, long, double, etc.) instead of boxed types (Integer, Long, Double, etc.) where possible to avoid unnecessary object creation and garbage collection.

- Proper Resource Management: Ensure that resources like streams, connections, and other I/O objects are properly closed after use. Using try-with-resources statements can automate this process.

- Weak References and Caches: Use weak references for caches or other large data structures that can be recreated, allowing the garbage collector to reclaim them when memory is needed.

      - Caches often hold a lot of data.
      - Some cache values are not critical and can be recomputed if needed.
      - Using WeakReference allows GC to free memory when needed, helping prevent OutOfMemoryError.

- Profiling for Memory Leaks: Regularly profile your application to identify and fix memory leaks, which can lead to increased garbage collection and latency.

    #### What is a Memory Leak in Java?
     In Java, a memory leak occurs when: Your application holds on to objects that are no longer needed, preventing the Garbage Collector (GC) from reclaiming their memory.Even though Java has automatic GC, it won’t collect objects that are still referenced, even if you're not using them anymore.

❗ Why is it bad?

     1. Memory leaks build up over time.
     2. JVM memory usage increases unnecessarily.
     3. GC runs more frequently and takes longer = latency increases.
     4. Eventually leads to OutOfMemoryError or performance degradation.
- Complexity Reduction: Focus on reducing the time complexity of algorithms. Even small changes in algorithmic efficiency can have significant impacts on performance, especially in large-scale or high-frequency operations.
- Loop Optimization: Simple techniques like minimizing work inside loops, avoiding method calls within loops, and loop unrolling can improve performance.

- Lazy Evaluation: Delay computation or object creation until absolutely necessary, especially for expensive operations.
- Understanding JIT Compilation: Java’s Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler optimizes code at runtime. Writing JIT-friendly code can enhance performance.
- Inlining and Loop Unrolling: These are common optimizations performed by JIT. Writing code that facilitates these optimizations can result in faster execution.

  ⚙️ JIT Optimizations:

   1. Inlining: Replaces method calls with method body (reduces overhead).
   2. Loop unrolling: Optimizes loops by reducing iteration cost.
   3. Escape analysis: Detects if objects can be allocated on the stack instead of heap.
   4. Dead code elimination: Removes unused computations.
