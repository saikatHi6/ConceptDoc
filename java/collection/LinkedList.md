**Merge sort is the best sorting algoritham to sort random linked list with minimum time complexity.** 
 
Both Merge sort and Insertion sort can be used for linked lists. The slow random-access performance of a linked list makes other algorithms (such as quicksort) perform poorly, and others (such as heapsort) completely impossible. Since worst case time complexity of Merge Sort is O(nLogn) and Insertion sort is O(n^2), merge sort is preferred. See following for implementation of merge sort using Linked List.
 
**We can not do binary search in link list**

Random access is not allowed. We have to access element sequentialy from the first node.

 Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.
