Collection concepts

#For loop over a collection

We can't add elements inside for loop. It will throw concurrentModificationExcetion. Cause size is not fixed. Every time size will increase. But remove is possible.

#Itarator

We can remove element. Add method is not supported by itarator.

#List Itarator

We can add elements through this.
